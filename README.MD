# ToDoom

A minimal ToDo application that permits only 5 tasks at a time.
Never get overwhelmed with ToDo lists again.

## Yet Another ToDo App

I know, right!? This project started off as a simple side project to practice DOM manipulation, and was originally coded entirely on CodePen.

It grew on me as I was building it and I saw the potential it had to practice other Javascript concepts that I'd picked up along the way, like Event Listeners, Intl Dates, this keyword, Call-Apply-Bind methods etc. So I just kept on finding ways to implement more concepts in some shape or form in the application.
